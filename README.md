Sequelize storage plugin for Errsole.

## What is Errsole?

Errsole is a Node.js logger with a built-in web dashboard. In this dashboard, you can easily view, filter, and search your app logs.

If your app uses Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, or SQL Server as its database, or if you prefer to store your app logs in one of these databases, you should install the "errsole-sequelize" module along with "errsole". This combination enables you to store your app logs in your chosen database.
